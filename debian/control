Package: dracut
Architecture: all
Multi-Arch: foreign

Provides: linux-initramfs-tool
Conflicts: initramfs-tools, live-tools
Description: Initramfs generator using udev
 This package builds a bootable initramfs for Linux kernel packages.  The
 initramfs is loaded along with the kernel and is responsible for
 mounting the root filesystem and starting the main init system.

Package: dracut-core
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: foreign
Recommends: cryptsetup, dmsetup, dmraid, lvm2, mdadm, console-setup, binutils, systemd, pigz, pkg-config

Description: dracut is an event driven initramfs infrastructure (core tools)
 Unlike existing initramfs's, this is an attempt at having as little as
 possible hard-coded into the initramfs as possible.  The initramfs has
 (basically) one purpose in life -- getting the rootfs mounted so that
 we can transition to the real rootfs.  This is all driven off of
 device availability.  Therefore, instead of scripts hard-coded to do
 various things, we depend on udev to create device nodes for us and
 then when we have the rootfs's device node, we mount and carry on.
 Having the root on MD, LVM2, LUKS is supported as well as NFS, iSCSI,
 NBD and FCOE with dracut-network.

Package: dracut-network
Architecture: all
Recommends: nfs-common, open-iscsi, nbd-client, curl
Depends: dracut-core, iputils-arping, isc-dhcp-client, ${misc:Depends}
Description: dracut is an event driven initramfs infrastructure (network modules)
 Package to build a dracut initramfs with network support. This
 includes dracut modules for NFS, CIFS, iSCSI, HTTP, NBD, FCP and FCOE.

Package: dracut-squash
Architecture: all
Depends: dracut-core, squashfs-tools, ${misc:Depends}
Breaks: dracut-core (<< 050-1)
Replaces: dracut-core (<< 050-1)
Description: dracut is an event driven initramfs infrastructure (squashfs modules)
 Package to build an initramfs with most files in a squashfs image.
 .
 This package provides a dracut module to build an initramfs, but
 store most files in a squashfs image, result in a smaller initramfs
 size and reduce runtime memory usage.

Description: dracut is an event driven initramfs infrastructure (live image modules)
 Package to build a dracut initramfs with live image capabilities.
 .
 This package requires everything which is needed to build an
 initramfs with dracut, with live image capabilities, like Live CDs.

Package: dracut-config-generic
